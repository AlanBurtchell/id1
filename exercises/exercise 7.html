        <h1>Exercise 7: Website Analysis</h1>
        <h2>96 Elephants</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stark, desolate, dreary.</li>
            <li>A solid red block with bright white text. Im assuming to represent blood and ivory.</li>
            <li>Dont really feel lost, just going down a straight path. The path takes some turns but your walled off and cant turn anywhere else, so you just keep going till the end.</li>
            <li>Instead of just text saying, keep going, you get a face to face picture of an elephant with the text saying "we need your help".</li>
            <li>To make you feel bad for not doing anything before seeing this. If you were doing something before seeing it, you feel bad for not doing more.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li>Bright, colorful, attention-grabbing.</li>
            <li>Explore, which shows you stuff about the trail currently. History, self explaining. Future, obvious meaning.</li>
            <li>A bit. There isnt really a clear and decisive way through it all. Its kinda just "hey, look at all this stuff".</li>
            <li>Yes</li>
            <li>Look at this stuff, gain a desire to help fund this project for the community you might not even be a part of, feel content after helping.</li>
        </ol>
