            <p id="whyitookthisclass">I took a look at my course outline to getting my studio arts degree and decided that I needed more to get an actual job with this degree. Having a design degree and studio degree is much better looking than jus the studio degree. It didn't help that I started to enjoy aspects of it so I wound up staying. Now Im here stuck between hating one thing but loving another, kinda feeling like Im in over my head at times.</p>
            <p id="mygoals">My goals I would have to say are the obvious get a job with my degree. Not be terrible, in my opinion, at doing this sort of thing. I have a habit of quiting things I start losing faith in. Lastly probably get something Ive designed used by a company I admire. I draw way too many "can concepts" in my brain dead free time for video games I play. While it does help keep me drawing and my brain in that mindset it isnt very professional to be drawing what essentially is fan art.</p>
