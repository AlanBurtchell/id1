        <h2>Wireframe</h2>

        <p>I wanted to create something different, this was my first problem, and that was doing it on a singer of a band and not the band itself. This meant I could fill it with more content from both of his bands as well as the singer himself. I used what I remembered from previous classes and decided to do something that works on a two collumn layout, which we hadnt learned yet.</p>
        <h2>Moodboard</h2>

        <p>This was aimed to be reflective on both bands as well as him. The light side representing his rock band and the darker side representing his metal band. Both for obvious reasons. At the center was a split sided mask linking the two sides through him. Also because masks are what hes known for.</p>

        <p2>I had a lot of aspirations for this project, most of which we had not learned how to do yet. Mainly the two collumn layout I was attempting to do, as seen in the wireframe. The two collumn layout would have been great for showing both sides of his music. So changes had to be made to finish it.</p2>
